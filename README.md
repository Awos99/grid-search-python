# Advanced Grid Search Techniques in Python for Credit Scoring Models

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook titled `Grid_Search_extended.ipynb` that provides an in-depth look at using advanced grid search techniques to optimize a decision tree classifier for credit risk assessment based on comprehensive customer data. The focus is on enhancing model accuracy by exploring various hyperparameters through systematic testing.

## Key Features
- **Detailed Dataset Description**: Utilizes a rich dataset containing financial information of 1000 customers, spanning 84 features related to their financial behavior and status, aimed at predicting credit risk and potential defaults.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Implements a sophisticated data preprocessing pipeline using `scikit-learn` that includes imputation, scaling, and encoding steps tailored for both numerical and categorical data.
- **Decision Tree Optimization**: Employs `GridSearchCV` to perform an exhaustive search over specified parameter values for a decision tree model. Parameters like criterion, max depth, and min samples split are adjusted to find the optimal model configuration.
- **Cross-Validation Strategy**: Uses cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness, minimizing the potential overfitting and providing a reliable assessment of its performance.

## Goals of This Project
The project aims to demonstrate the power of grid search in machine learning workflows, specifically for the purpose of credit scoring, which can help financial institutions assess the risk levels of potential clients more effectively.
